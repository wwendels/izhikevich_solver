# izhikevich_solver

Constructs for two-dimensional ODEs:
- the phase plane,
- nullclines, 
- equilibria, 
- the trajectory for a given initial condition up to a specified time t, 
- the time series of the variables up to the same time t,
and corresponding GIFs which give some intuition how a neuron spiking is related to the dynamics of the model.

The implemented 2D ODEs are ODE models for neuronal spiking, in particular: 
- the Izhikevich model, 
- the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, 
- the persistent sodium and potassium model,
The description of all these models can be found in the Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience book by Izhikevich.
